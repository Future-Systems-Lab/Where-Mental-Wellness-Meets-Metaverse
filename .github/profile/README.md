# 🧠 Where Mental Wellness Meets the Metaverse

Welcome. I’m **Dr. Meg Montañez-Davenport** — a doctor of naturopathic psychology and healthcare data scientist building an **encrypted, decentralized mental wellness ecosystem**.

This ecosystem unites **Web3, AI, gamification, and trauma-informed care** to create a future of private, user-directed, scalable mental health support.

---

## 🚩 Why This Ecosystem Exists
The current mental health system often:
- Prioritizes profit over people.
- Ignores trauma and biochemical individuality.
- Compromises privacy, autonomy, and dignity.
- Limits access due to stigma, cost, and systemic failures.

We are building a system that **doesn’t ask for permission to exist** — one that uses **decentralization and encryption** to deliver healing resources directly to individuals, honoring their right to privacy and self-directed growth.

---

## 🛠️ What This Ecosystem Includes
- ✅ Encrypted health communications  
- ✅ Gamified behavioral reprogramming tools  
- ✅ Decentralized record management  
- ✅ Anonymity-preserving practitioner collaboration  
- ✅ Tokenized rewards for healing milestones  
- ✅ Data sovereignty for research participation without exposure
