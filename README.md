# 🧠 Where Mental Wellness Meets the Metaverse

Welcome. I’m Dr. Meg Montañez-Davenport — a **practitioner turned builder** and **Digital Health & Web3 Architect** developing an encrypted, decentralized mental wellness ecosystem.  

This ecosystem combines Web3, AI, gamification, and trauma-informed care to deliver private, user-directed, and scalable mental health support.  

🔗 Built on the therapeutic foundation and business model of the Naturopathic Psychology & Hypnosis Center — see [hypnosispsych.com](https://hypnosispsych.com) for core modalities and ethos.

## 🚩 Why This Ecosystem Exists
The current mental health system often:
- Prioritizes profit over people
- Ignores trauma and biochemical individuality
- Compromises privacy, autonomy, and dignity
- Limits access due to stigma, cost, and systemic failures

**We are building a system that doesn’t ask for permission to exist.**  
It uses decentralization and encrypted systems to deliver **healing resources directly to individuals**, honoring their right to privacy and self-directed growth.

## 🛠️ What This Ecosystem Includes
Where Mental Wellness Meets the Metaverse is a **modular infrastructure** designed to support:

✅ Encrypted health communications  
✅ Gamified behavioral reprogramming tools  
✅ Decentralized record management  
✅ Anonymity-preserving practitioner collaboration  
✅ Tokenized rewards for healing milestones  
✅ Data sovereignty for research participation without exposure

## 🌐 Featured Projects
### 🛡️ EncryptHealth
Decentralized, encrypted health communication replacing insecure email/portals while enabling trauma-informed collaboration.

### 🌀 HypnoNeuro
A gamified, NFT-enabled platform providing structured trauma recovery and mental wellness pathways in a private, user-controlled environment.

> Additional production code for these projects is maintained in **private repositories**.  
> YC reviewers and collaborators may **request read access**.
