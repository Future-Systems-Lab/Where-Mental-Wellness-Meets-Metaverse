# 🧠 Where Mental Wellness Meets the Metaverse

Welcome. I'm **Dr. Meg Montañez-Davenport**, a doctor of naturopathic psychology and healthcare data scientist on a mission to reinvent mental health through ethical, encrypted, and decentralized digital healing.

This work brings together Web3, AI, gamification, and clinical psychology to build a trauma-informed future — one where care is radically private, reward-driven, and fully controlled by the user.

---

## 🚨 What We're Solving

Mental healthcare today fails people at every level — and not because they don't want help. People avoid or abandon the system because:

* 💸 **Therapy is too expensive** — trauma-informed care is out of reach for most.
* 🧠 **Shame and stigma** keep people silent, especially in marginalized communities.
* 💊 **Side effects of medications** make things worse, not better.
* 🚫 **Treatments often don’t work** — one-size-fits-all pills can't heal trauma.
* ❌ **People don’t trust providers** — especially after being dismissed, misdiagnosed, or overmedicated.
* 🔍 **There are not enough practitioners** — especially those trained in trauma, identity, and holistic approaches.
* 🔒 **No privacy** — traditional care is tracked, billed, and recorded by centralized systems.
* 📂 **People have no control over their data or records** — and no option to opt out.

This ecosystem is being built to dismantle those barriers.

### How We're Rebuilding It:

* **IPFS & Filecoin** for decentralized storage — no central database, no institutional oversight
* **Avatar-based anonymity** so users can seek care without shame or exposure
* **ERC-20 tokens** to replace insurance and allow session access through earned or purchased credits
* **ERC-721 NFTs** to mark unique therapeutic progress, unlock discount tiers, and serve as verifiable milestones on-chain
* **Gamified daily challenges** to make healing consistent, rewarding, and user-directed
* **Encrypted, pseudonymous practitioner messaging** — no real names required

This is trauma-informed care redesigned for a digital-first world: private, affordable, decentralized, and built on user choice.

* **IPFS & Filecoin** for decentralized health record storage
* **Avatar anonymity** to eliminate judgment
* **Tokenized access** that lowers costs and builds self-agency
* **NFT rewards** as proof of progress and commitment
* **Gamified healing** to encourage consistency and engagement

## 🧬 What's Under the Hood

* **Decentralized Infrastructure** using Ethereum, IPFS, and encrypted identity layers
* **Filecoin & Arweave** for distributed, persistent storage of anonymized records and progress tracking
* **ENS (Ethereum Name Service)** for pseudonymous practitioner handles and simplified navigation
* **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)** to verify therapeutic engagement without revealing sensitive data
* **Decentralized Identity (DID) Frameworks** for user-owned, self-sovereign identity and access
* **Chainlink Oracles** to bridge off-chain healing milestones with on-chain rewards and automation
* **Polygon & Optimism** as Ethereum-compatible networks enabling lower-cost access and faster gamified interactions
* **MetaMask & WalletConnect** support for seamless pseudonymous login and token usage
* **Behavioral Analytics & Gamified Loops** for sustained user healing
* **AI-Powered Matching** to connect users with licensed practitioners — pseudonymously
* **ETL Pipelines** converting real clinical data into OMOP standard for de-identified research and evidence-building
* **ERC-721 Certificates** as non-transferable, on-chain proof of healing milestones, unlocking token-based access and deeper program layers using Ethereum, IPFS, and encrypted identity layers
* **Behavioral Analytics & Gamified Loops** for sustained user healing
* **AI-Powered Matching** to connect users with licensed practitioners — pseudonymously
* **ETL Pipelines** converting real clinical data into OMOP standard for de-identified research and evidence-building
* **ERC-721 Certificates** as non-transferable, on-chain proof of healing milestones, unlocking token-based access and deeper program layers

## 👩🏽‍💻 About Me

**Dr. Meg Montañez-Davenport**
Doctor of Naturopathic Psychology | Healthcare Data Scientist
Founder of HypnoNeuro and EncryptHealth

With over 30 years of experience in patient care and 20+ years as a licensed provider, I now focus on developing decentralized mental health systems that prioritize user sovereignty, anonymity, and access.

My academic and technical credentials include:

* **Health Informatics – Johns Hopkins University**
* **Certified Blockchain & Healthcare Professional (CBHP)** – Blockchain Council
* **Bachelor of Science in Analytics (Data Science focus)** – in progress
* **Advanced training in OMOP data standardization, privacy-first architectures, and smart contract systems**

This work is both a personal mission and a professional rebellion—created to confront everything the current system refuses to fix: overmedication, disempowerment, centralized control, and its abandonment of the Hippocratic Oath: *first, do no harm*.
