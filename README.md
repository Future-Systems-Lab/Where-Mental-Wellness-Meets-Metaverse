# 🧠 Where Mental Wellness Meets the Metaverse

Welcome. I’m **Dr. Meg Montañez-Davenport**, a doctor of naturopathic psychology and healthcare data scientist building an encrypted, decentralized mental wellness ecosystem.

This ecosystem unites **Web3, AI, gamification, and trauma-informed care** to create **a future of private, user-directed, scalable mental health support.**

---

## 🚩 Why This Ecosystem Exists

The current mental health system often:
* Prioritizes profit over people.
* Ignores trauma and biochemical individuality.
* Compromises privacy, autonomy, and dignity.
* Limits access due to stigma, cost, and systemic failures.

**We are building a system that doesn’t ask for permission to exist.** It uses decentralization and encrypted systems to deliver **healing resources directly to individuals**, honoring their right to privacy and self-directed growth.

## 🛠️ What This Ecosystem Includes

Where Mental Wellness Meets the Metaverse is a **modular infrastructure** designed to support:

✅ **Encrypted health communications**  
✅ **Gamified behavioral reprogramming tools**  
✅ **Decentralized record management**  
✅ **Anonymity-preserving practitioner collaboration**  
✅ **Tokenized rewards for healing milestones**
